Understanding what a statistician does sometimes is hard to explain; this makes it hard for an organization to be data-driven.  So to understand some key concepts related to this, we could start by using the analogy of fishing.

## Point estimates
Let's start by imagining we are on the shore of a lake, and there's only one fish.

So the first option we have is to use a fishing rod. If we are on a big lake, it will take a lot of time, and we will have to move around the shore many times.

This is precisely the idea behind the mean or the proportion of a population. We are trying to give a good estimate of each of the metrics.
